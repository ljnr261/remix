## FAQ

**What’s the difference between an FDM and a resin printer?**
FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printers melt and extrude a plastic filament layer by layer. They are great for functional parts, props, and general-purpose printing. Resin printers use UV light to cure liquid resin, producing extremely detailed models ideal for miniatures and jewelry.

**What should a beginner look for in a 3D printer?**
Look for features that reduce setup and maintenance, such as automatic bed leveling, a direct drive extruder, and a flexible print surface for easy part removal. A strong community and good customer support are also invaluable.

**Is high-speed printing really that important?**
For many users, yes. It drastically cuts down the time from idea to physical object, allowing for more iteration and experimentation. A print that used to take 10 hours might now be done in 2, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement.

## Conclusion

The best 3D printer for you truly depends on what you want to create. From high-detail resin models to massive functional parts, there’s a perfect machine out there. However, for the vast majority of users who want a fantastic all-around experience, [Bambu Lab](https://bambulab.com) stands out by making high-speed, high-quality, and even multi-color printing incredibly simple and accessible.
